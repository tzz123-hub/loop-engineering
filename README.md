**Loop engineering is replacing yourself as the person who prompts the agent. You design the system that does it instead.**

A loop is a recursive goal: you define a purpose and the AI iterates (often with sub-agents, verification, and external state) until the goal is complete or the loop decides to hand off to you.

## Why This Matters

Peter Steinberger:
> “You shouldn’t be prompting coding agents anymore. You should be designing loops that prompt your agents.”

Boris Cherny (Head of Claude Code at Anthropic):
> “I don’t prompt Claude anymore. I have loops running that prompt Claude and figuring out what to do. My job is to write loops.”

The leverage point has moved from crafting individual prompts to designing the control systems that orchestrate agents over time.

## The Five Building Blocks + Memory

| Primitive | Job in the Loop |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Automations / Scheduling** | Discovery + triage on a cadence |
| **Worktrees** | Safe parallel execution |
| **Skills** | Persistent project knowledge |
| **Plugins & Connectors** | Reach into your real tools (MCP) |
| **Sub-agents** | Maker / checker split |
| **+ Memory / State** | Durable spine outside any conversation |

## Getting Started (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Clone this repo or copy a starter into your project
cp -r starters/minimal-loop/.grok/skills/loop-triage .grok/skills/
cp starters/minimal-loop/STATE.md.example STATE.md

# 2. Audit readiness
cd tools/loop-audit && npm install && npm run build
node dist/cli.js /path/to/your/project

# 3. Start report-only (Grok)
/loop 1d Run loop-triage. Update STATE.md. No auto-fix in week one.
```

Phased rollout: **L1 report → L2 assisted fixes → L3 unattended** — see [loop-design-checklist](docs/loop-design-checklist.md).

## Operating & Safety

- [Failure Modes](docs/failure-modes.md) — incident-style catalog
- [Operating Loops](docs/operating-loops.md) — cost, logging, when to kill
- [Safety](docs/safety.md) — denylist, auto-merge, MCP scopes
- [Concepts](docs/concepts.md) — intent debt, comprehension debt, harness vs loop

## Caveats

Loop engineering amplifies judgment — both good and bad.

- **Token costs** can explode with sub-agents and long-running loops.
- **Verification is still on you.** Unattended loops make unattended mistakes.
- **Comprehension debt** grows faster unless you read what the loop ships.
- Two people can run the same loop and get opposite results. The loop doesn't know. You do.
